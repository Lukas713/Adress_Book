www.shellscript.sh/exercises.html
Okay, it's boring, but here's your exercise for today:
Create an addressbook program using the bourne or bourne-again shell.
It should use functions to perform the required tasks. It should be menu-based, allowing you the options of:

Search address book
Add entries
Remove / edit entries
You will also need a "display" function to display a record or records when selected.

Search
When the user searches for "Smith", the script should identify and display all "Smith" records. It is up to you whether this search is in Surname only, or in the entire record.
Add
Input the data (Name, Surname, Email, Phone, etc).
If it appears to be a duplicate, for bonus points offer to edit the existing record.
Save the record into the data file when the user confirms.
Remove
Enter search criteria, narrow it down to one, confirm, then remove that record.
